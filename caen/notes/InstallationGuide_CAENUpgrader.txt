This is a short guide to installing the CAENUpgrader tool provided by
CAEN to update/modify the VME firmware for CAEN boards (V1718, V1720,
etc). It shows how to install when the CAEN libraries are _not_
installed on the system in /usr/local, as well as how to fix a bug in
the current version (amateurs). The following assumes that the user is
installing _from_ the ADAQ repository.

Note that the bug as already been fixed in the version contained in
the repo, but the whole binary may required rebuilding on different
machines (x86 vs. x86_64 for example).

This applies to CAENUpgrader version : 1.4.1

0. Run configure utility with the following arguments to specify the
   _local_ location of the header and library files in the ADAQ repo.

   $ ./configure --prefix=/home/hartwig/aims/ADAQ/caen/software/CAENUpgrader-1.4.1 \
                 --exec-prefix=/home/hartwig/aims/ADAQ/caen/software/CAENUpgrader-1.4.1 \
		 CFLAGS=-I/home/hartwig/aims/ADAQ/include \
                 CPPFLAGS=-I/home/hartwig/aims/ADAQ/include \
		 LDFLAGS=-L/home/hartwig/aims/ADAQ/lib/x86_64

1. The file cvUpgrade/src/cvupgrade.c has a fucking bug in it. Line
   680 looks for the type 'CAENComm_PCI_OpticalLink', which is simply
   an enum value equal that should be equal to 1. This type name
   existed in previous CAENComm versions (e.g. 1.02) but has been
   removed in the most up-to-date version (1.2.0). The type has been
   changed to 'CAENComm_OpticalLink' in version 1.2.0. Fucking A. Fix
   this in the source code:

   $ emacs -nw cvUpgrade/src/cvupgrade.c
   
   Change 'CAENComm_PCI_OpticalLink' to 'CAENComm_OpticalLink'


2. Build and locally install the source. Note, their fucking Makefile
   does _not_ allow true local installation but requires sudo access
   to /etc for some unknown reason that I don't have time to fix. Fuck.

   $ make
   $ sudo make install


3. CAENUpgraderGUI requires knowledge of the other build
   executables. Therefore, temporarily add the bin/ directory
   to the path:

   $ cd bin/
   $ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH


3. To run:

   $ CAENUpgraderGUI
